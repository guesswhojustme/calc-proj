# calc-proj
simple calculator project

part of the TOP course final proj. coded this app by simply observing how calculator works with no external help of anything and anyone, so im very proud of it. its one of the projects that i thought i was going to get stuck on debugging for days/weeks, or giving it all up by finding solutions online, but fortunately it didnt end up like that.

you can check this (https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/basic.php) since its heavily inspired how my calculator works
the only difference is it doesnt have much functionalities as the inspired calculator has, but it calculates the same way.
